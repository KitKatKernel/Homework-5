# Task Board Project (Week 5)

## What is This Project?

This week's project is a Task Board application designed to help a team manage project tasks.

- **Why Did I Make This?**: To practice and enhance my skills in JavaScript, jQuery and a little bit of Bootstrap, by creating a dynamic and interactive task management application. This project also taught me more about using the Day.js library for date manipulation and jQuery UI for drag-and-drop functionality.
- **What's in It?**: The application includes a main page where tasks can be added, viewed, and managed. Users can add new tasks, delete existing tasks, and drag tasks between different columns representing their progress (To-Do, In Progress, and Done). The task cards are color-coded based on their due dates, providing visual indicators for task urgency.
- **What Did I Learn?**: This project helped me understand the integration of various JavaScript libraries and the importance of debugging for a better user experience in web applications. I learned about DOM manipulation, handling local storage, implementing and debugging drag-and-drop functionality, and maintaining consistent styling.

## Credits

A heartfelt thank you to my bootcamp instructors and peers for their continuous guidance and support. Special thanks to W3schools and MDN for their comprehensive resources on JavaScript. The tutorials and documentation from these sites were invaluable in helping me understand various concepts like local storage keys, using JSON.stringify, and implementing the functionality for this project.
